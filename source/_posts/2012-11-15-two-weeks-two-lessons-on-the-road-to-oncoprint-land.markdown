I'm not the only one who loves the [d3js library](http://d3js.org/).

Data is a list.

One of the things that d3 teaches me is that data is a list.  What does this
mean?

1. You iterate over it
2. There is some uniformity to it, i.e. and of course by list I mean a typed
   list.  So I don't mean some list `[elephant, mars, chair]`.  I don't even
   mean a list like this `[1, "higgly", "biggly"]`.  I mean a list of "structs"
   with the same structure.  Like a bunch of integers, `[1,2,3, ...]`.  Or a
   bunch of names `["Arabic poet", "Chinese poet", ...]`.  Or a bunch of
   combinations of names and numbers `[{name: "Joseph", index: 10}, {name:
   "Reuben", index:2}, ....]`
