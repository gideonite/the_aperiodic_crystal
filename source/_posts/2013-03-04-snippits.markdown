# from "Teachings of D3" post

I think it is that data structures are extremely important.  People certainly
say this all the time, but this was one of those moments when I realized it for
myself and was happy. The visualization is not organized around datatype (copy
number, mutation, etc), but rather around samples (or take the transpose of the
matrix and consider it gene-wise, shouldn't matter).  Why fight the natural
thing and try to draw it in layers?

So the data structure should probably be as flat as possible and the rendered
elements should use svg `<g>` elements that correspond to samples and which
contain whatever glyphs.

Philosophically, I may as well make a few small points about this.
