Far far from the top of the moutain -- the full view -- I see two major
elements to software.  This is somewhat inspired by the little bit of Feynman's
Lectures of Computation that I had the pleasure of picking up and the sadness
of not taking the time to finish.  Feynman talks about how a significant amount
of the work that computers do amounts to file keeping.  Of course, along the
way you end up having to think about some interesting and complex ways of
dealing with file keeping and paper pushing but at the end of the day, it
really is just that.  Meanwhile, there are other questions that have to do with
algorithms and doing interesting things with those files (of course, when
making the good file keeping system you are going to end up having to think
about the types of things you are going to have to ask of the data later, so
that this is surely an artificial separation).  So basically, you have your
data and you have the things that you do to your data.

OOP, is a perfect example of something that amounts to fancy file keeping.  At
the end of the day it really is just a way of organizing code.  Yes, it ends up
feeling like you are dealing with abstract concepts and doing abstract
reasoning, and surely you are, but the practical import of this exercise is
code that is essentially well organized.  That is why object oriented
programming is not to be compared with "functional" or "procedural" based
programming, it is tangential to it.  "Functional" and "procedural" are
different ways of writing algorithms, OOP is how you organize those algorithmic
components.
