Hello, my name is Gideon Dresdner. I am currently the principal blogger on *The
Aperiodic Crystal*.  If you have ideas or articles that you would like to
contribute, please contact me!

I write software in Chris Sanders' group at [cBio@MSKCC](http://cbio.mskcc.org/).

I am an avid traveller, trekker, cyclist, and amateur Chinese wrestler (摔跤
Shuāi Jiāo).  I also like learning languages, compiled by both mind and
machine!

Here are two photos from my climb up Mount Musala, Bulgaria in 2011. I'm the
one in the orange shirt. Kudos to Lucas Schmidt for these photos, wherever he
may be.
