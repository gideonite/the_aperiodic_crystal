Hello, my name is Gideon Dresdner. I am currently the principal blogger on *The
Aperiodic Crystal*.  If you have ideas or articles that you would like to
contribute, please contact me!

I recently left my job writing software in Chris Sanders' group at
[cBio@MSKCC](http://cbio.mskcc.org/) to be a hackerschooler in the Fall 2013
batch.  I can think of anything I'd rather be doing right now.

I am an avid traveller, trekker, cyclist, and amateur Chinese wrestler (摔跤
Shuāi Jiāo).  I also like learning languages, compiled by both mind and
machine!

Here are two photos from my climb up Mount Musala, Bulgaria in 2011. I'm the
one in the orange shirt. Kudos to Lucas Schmidt for these photos, wherever he
may be.
